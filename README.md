## Overview

Crimson Campaigns is a web application which coordinates the storage and
management of data for on-campus campaign efforts. This tool is designed to
assist those registering voters on campus, such as with the
[Harvard Votes Challenge](https://ash.harvard.edu/vote), as well as those seeking
to join the Undergraduate Council - either in their house/yard or as a candidate
for executive office. There is also an "other" option to allow users to employ
this framework to store data focusing on the entire campus for any other cause
requiring a campus-wide campaign.

## Step 1: Create an Account

All users of Crimson Campaigns are given a unique database with varying
storage fields to suit the needs of their particular campaign. Thus, registration
is perhaps the most important step of this process; luckily, the fields are fairly
self-explanatory.

## Step 2: Add Data

Get out in the field! This software allows the logging of voter contacts to give
campaigns a sense of the progress they are making, but the heavy lifting is
still on the field organizing level.

Click "Data Input" to access the data input window. There are a large number of
fields to capture a variety of useful info, but only the first and last name fields
are required, allowing for flexibility in cases where only partial data collection
is possible.

Voter registration efforts capture more data than simple campaigns, focusing on
a user's registration status and whether or not they've requested a ballot. Information
about where users are registered is also requested to ease in supplying relevant
resources for user assistance and deadline updates.

Campaigns collect numeric support metrics on a scale from 1 ("strong support") to
5 ("strong opposition"). This is useful both to keep a sense of how a candidate's
chances are looking and to target supporters for "Get Out The Vote" efforts.

Email, dorm, entryway, and phone number fields serve to facilitate Get Out The Vote
efforts, reminders about registration deadlines, knowing where to send volunteers
for campaign literature drops, etc.

## Step 3: Manage Data

The "Search Data" tab allows for a filtered search through stored records using
substrings which lead to individual's names. Additionally, there are buttons on
each record in this tab in order to open an "update voter info" tab in which
individual records can be altered. This update feature, however, is still in development.

## Step 4: View Progress

The "View Progress" tab allows for users to see various pie charts tracking
their progress against the number of voters they haven't contacted based on
estimates of total populations in different dorms and houses. Unfortunately,
access to lists of eligible voters are not available for different causes,
so these will be estimates.
