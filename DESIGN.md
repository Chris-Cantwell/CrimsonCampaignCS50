# CrimsonCampaignCS50 - Design

Crimson Campaigns is a Flask app primarily focused on integration


*I will admit that I struggled with time far more than I expected to, not sure
what part of that is over-ambition and which part comes to my own ability and
workflow.

As a result, this is fairly unfinished and not in the state I would have liked
it to be for presentation. However, I learned a lot and am still invested in
this idea, and would like to continue work on it, especially after learning more
through CS50 Beyond.

This idea was partially inspired by my work with the Harvard Votes Challenge,
and something like this could be useful for voter registration efforts come 2020*
